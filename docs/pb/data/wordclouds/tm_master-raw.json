    "so...": 1,
    "it was originally formed in 1999 as halabalooza based on starcraft": 1,

    "in deva": 1,

    "in these settings, at least": 1,
    "eh people like to experiment with multiple anchors on occasion/different anchor ships": 1,
    "but i agree baked, that..i wish there was some way to set a specific behaviour on the other ships if they're anchor": 1,
    "it's allset like ship 3": 1,
    "is the default :p": 1,
    "even for 7 sort of..they dont do much": 1,
    "tbh": 1,
    "i mean, tbh, baked..any ship here can be an anchor if you set the behaviour for shooting right": 1,
    "thing is, a lot of ships would need to use guns more for htat": 1,
    "instead of just mostly bombs": 1,
    "or all bombs": 1,
    "anchors also need logic for conserving energy": 1,
    "if other ships were to be used": 1,
    "as everything drains you differently in here": 1,
    "yeah, that's good, but..": 1,
    "i mean like for instance, in ship 1 you can do it, but you have to stay further back": 1,
    "and use mostly multifire guns": 1,
    "and lob occasional bombs": 1,
    "in ship 2, i've anchored, but it's like all singlefire guns": 1,
    "very rarely do you even bomb": 1,
    "ship 4 could anch with bombs": 1,
    "and occasional multi": 1,
    "ship 5 could anch if it used bombs + multifire bullets on occasion combo": 1,
    "ship 6 , same, but you have to account for the delay in using items with that ship": 1,
    "err i meant guns, singlefire in 6*": 1,
    "and bombs have no bounce, just emp in that, so..if it was a straight bomb yea": 1,
    "im pretty sure ship 1 has higher damage than 4's lol": 1,
    "and 1s has lower energy drain": 1,
    "1's guns are level 3 i think": 1,
    "level 2 for 4 i think": 1,
    "but fire rate is the thing": 1,
    "the bullets are way more spread out with ship 1 multi, but you can fire almost constant with low drain": 1,
    "just wears the enemy down": 1,
    "the settings are actually really skill-based, although it doesn't seem like it": 1,
    "you can have success in any role in any ship": 1,
