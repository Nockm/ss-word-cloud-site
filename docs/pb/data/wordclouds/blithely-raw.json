    "i see that the manifest destiny was born of christianity and that gave license to kill in the name of god. then they burn females in the name of god against satan. and that is just the large scale.": 1,
    "then there are all the crazy fuckers who go around talling the world to be saved and that is another insanity": 1,
    "because once they think they are saved, they are on a pedistal and feel they are better than others. so judgement sets in.": 1,

    "and that you are the good one.": 1,
    "and even if you are the good one, there is still the problem of the millions of assholes who also assert their specialness of being saved and having turned to good.": 1,
    "how would i know? recoignize them by their fruit? i would have to start judging people to pick out what i think is good or bad and then see if they have the christain identification. see the problem?": 1,
    "exactly. people are nuts no matter. therefore, a fking nut case who claims to be a good person because they \"believe\" in jesus is even rebukable by jesus himself.": 1,
    "actually, the part you are missing is that i don't see anyone as being \"good\".": 1,
    "that's why people get so offended by me. they see themselves are good, but i don't. people hate that about me. i don't validate them.": 1,
    "let's stop pretending. people only like those who agree with them.": 1,
    "this is not about right and wrong, it's about agreeing or disagreeing.": 1,
    "people want to be around those who agree with them. but even at that, those same people will use and abuse each other.": 1,
