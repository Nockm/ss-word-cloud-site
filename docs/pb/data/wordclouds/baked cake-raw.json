    "when its in center": 1,
    "i changed it so it stops looping through the weapons once it gets both the bomb and the bullet levels": 1,
    "maybe slightly better": 1,
    "at least for that player": 1,
    "i should probably tell it to ignore spectators": 1,
    "would be interesting to try": 1,

    "oh yeah": 2,
    "i need to subtract from i right": 1,
    "will it matter if i is 0": 1,
    "like it finds a player at index 0, gets subtracted to 999999999 or whatever, but its incremented back to 0 before the test right": 1,
    "i got rid of the flags to stop looking at bullets because its kind of dumb": 1,
    "how will it upgrade a prize if it only watches when the player chages ships": 1,

    "yeah thats how i started doing it": 1,

    "for a second before they hit the wall it loosk like they are running away and they get a negative speed value": 1,
    "then they hit the wall and its positive": 1,

    "i cant even get the exception to pop up though": 1,

    "i thought about it": 1,
    "before i was just checking if any players were not connected to the current base": 1,
    "and then stoppping there nad setting the current base": 1,

    "ialways go that crash though": 1,

    "in any map": 1,

    "also there was a bug when one of the bots would get stuck in a differnt base": 1,
    "all the other bots would attach to it and break the game": 1,
    "that should hopefully be solved": 1,
    "you can always use the anchordistance command": 1,
    "but i was comparing its distance next to the old marv and it looked about right": 1,
    "default is 45 path tiles": 1,
    "so if you set anchordistance to 10 its 55": 1,
    "basically the command just adds to whatever its calculating": 1,
    "well its 45 tiles plus a range of 0-10 added depneding on its energy level": 1,
    "plus it also watches its velocity and the enemies velocity and calculates a braking distance": 1,
    "but basically if you jsut use anchordistance 10 it will just move 10 tiles back": 1,
    "and if you do -10 it gets closer": 1,
    "if its trying to back up but it cant go any further, it just squats in safe": 1,
    "might be better than just floating arouknd and getting killed": 1,
    "it might be able to get a huge rec heh": 1,
    "well theres still a bug where if the enemy gets on the same safe tile the bot will run out of safe": 1,
