    "my hardware is acting up in the weirdest way": 1,
    "some problem in the memory or the interface to it": 1,
    "started crashing randomly. so i underclocked it. worked decent, makes sense with old memories i guess": 1,
    "if i run on just one module, most of the time it works. well, all of the time with one of the sticks, and most of the time with the other one": 1,
    "so it might be both one of the modules, and the interface..": 1,
    "anyway, here's the weird part. had both modules in, it got into a boot loop, so i took out one of them to make changes in bios": 1,
    "for the hell of it, i put it higher than it is rated... booted up on one stick, no surprise, i upped the voltage a tiny bit to cope; small change either way": 1,
    "then i put in both sticks, and that also worked like a charm.. lol wtf is that?": 1,
    "at first, i ran it at 800mhz just to not crash all the time, then i crank it up to 1866 (rated 1600) and that works...": 1,
    "ya i'm just expressing it. seems to work, so it's no bother, just curious": 1,
    "the main take away is probably that my hardware is screwed either way ^^": 1,
    "they are": 1,

    "never an issue, yeah": 1,

    "gotta switch tasks in and out more": 1,
    "fisty, i brushed the faulty stick with a tooth brush, the pins seemed a bit eaten away. i dunno if it worked, but it seemed to improve a little bit": 1,

    "ya donn, they are usually a lower end model, even if it has the same name": 1,
    "at least that's how it used to be": 1,
    "that's why they use lower and, that run on lower tdp": 1,
    "lower end*": 1,
    "these days, you can buy a desktop gpu tower though, and just plug it in via usb on the laptop lol": 1,
    "ye they usually mess with the clock rates": 1,
    "maybe there are other changes as well. oh yeah, they disable part of the hardware, like the render pipelines": 1,
    "they make high end cards, some come off semi-wonky, so they disable parts of it, and market it as lower tdp :d": 1,
    "so the laptop model might have 128 instead of 192 pipelines or wutever they're called": 1,
    "ya. it makes sense too, make use of the parts that do work; they get tested to the same standards as other cards": 1,
    "ya, these days man.. stability is everything": 1,
    "i cannot be bothered with fiddling around 24/7 ^^": 1,
    "i bought this one when i was 10 years younger, and even then i was like \"i'll get the overclockable one, but i'll do it in the future if necessary\" ^^": 1,
    "been running stock speeds ever since": 1,
    "i did get a 200mhz boost today though, updated the bios as part of a debugging process ^^": 1,
    "hmm, it was somewhat substantial on this cpu. it kinda got into the same range as higher end cpus. but you gotta get better cooling and stuff. would not bother with any of that these days": 1,
    "i did pick this cpu because the oc would at least make some difference, but it probably still wouldn't be much": 1,
    "like, if i had overclocked it back then, it might have been a big upgrade, but today, probably not": 1,
    "i'll go dig up some oc results with this bastard, see if it's worthwhile, just for fun": 1,
    "lol naga, this is probably extreme, but someone got it running at 4.9ghz (from 3.5 stock)": 1,
