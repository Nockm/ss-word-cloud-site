    "and when you're between the goal and the player and he scores. you didn't get the ball fire packet before the server got his score packet": 1,
    "and it's possible also because the other player's connection sucks such that the server basically gets both the ball fire packet and the score packet at nearly the same time": 1,
    "which basically gives you 0 chance to grab it": 1,
    "poid wanted to change the logic so that if the server saw you between, it would forcibly give the defender the ball, but that's not a good solution because the server might not know you warped away": 1,

    "i've been playing around with .net 9 stuff": 1,
    "omg smashed": 1,
    "arrrh": 1,
    "so, today i was messing around with using the alternate lookup stuff": 1,
    "that is, so that you can access a dictionary or hashset with a span": 1,
    "i actually made my own data structure to work around the issue": 1,
    "but using a dictionary in certain cases is better (less memory usage)": 1,
    "so i'm switching some back to dictionary and hashset": 1,
    "basically, i dont allocate strings (almost always)": 1,
    "so to get around places where i needed to do a lookup, i had to work around the fact that you could only search a string keyed dictionary or hashset by allocating a string": 1,
    "so i created a trie data structure with very similar trygetvalue, add, and remove methods which take a span and do not allocate strings": 1,
    "now they provide a way to do it with dictionary and hashset, which eliminiates some of what i worked around, not all": 1,
    "for example if you run a command like ?lag": 1,
    "i get the bytes, stackallocate the buffer for characters, decode the data into it, then i parse the string for the command name": 1,
    "then it will look up \"lag\" to see if it's a command": 1,
    "no string allocations at all, but now i can do it with a dictionary": 1,
    "yea, allocations are bad because at some point the garbage collector will need to run": 1,
    "when the garbage collector runs, it can't do anything else at the same time (i think)": 1,
    "i find it to be about 2 ms": 1,
    "on average": 1,
    "so a 2 ms of not being able to process is not nice": 1,
    "yea, i never had to worry about any of this stuff in business apps": 1,
    "the server is a totally different beast": 1,
    "when it decides to": 1,
    "ya, i put a lot of effort a while back to not allocate": 1,
    "and i have it such that most objects that i do have to allocate are reusable, pooled objects": 1,
    "takes more effort to write them though": 1,
    "well, it's dictionary-like": 1,
    "and i have other uses for it too": 1,
    "look up trie data structure": 1,
    "it's good for when you want to find everything that start with something": 1,
    "yea, so one spot it's useful is settings": 1,
    "on the server settings are in sections": 1,
    "so i have all the settings in a trie by <sections>:<key>": 1,
    "so to find all settings in a given section i just search for all starting with <section>:": 1,
    "which is how my version of ?man <section>: works": 1,
    "for example ?man all:": 1,
    "which will list the settings for all ships": 1,
    "asss does it differently": 1,
    "yea, so every .net release there is something i've been waiting for": 1,
    "no, it knows they are not leaf nodes": 1,
    "they use the same nodes": 1,
    "the k and the n are leaf": 1,
    "the data structure takes a lot of memory though": 1,
    "also, a single hashtable lookup is faster than having to lookup each character": 1,
    "each node has to have a collection of other nodes": 1,
    "which in my case i used a dictionary, but could also just be a plain array": 1,
    "yeah, which is why i'm switching back to dictionary and hashset for most": 1,
    "i'm in the middle of it": 1,
    "halfway there": 1,
    "i also started using their new memoryextensions.split method which allows you to enumerate": 1,
    "i made my own split type thing which i use to enumerate the tokens. it's not as nice as theirs": 1,
    "so, i'll slowly convert stuff over to use theirs": 1,
    "another interesting thing i'm planning on using is system.buffers.searchvalues<string>": 1,
    "i've needed to be bleeding edge to achieve what i want on the server": 1,
    "so, the place i plan to use the searchvalues<string> is for the obscenity filter": 1,
    "basically, the server gets configured with a bunch of naughty words and it will replace them when it finds them": 1,
    "the searchvalues thing should speed it up a lot": 1,
    "i didn't really look into exactly how they implement it": 1,
    "they use the simd instructinos or seomthing i think": 1,
    "which i think might be the avx stuff": 1,
    "another thing i want to change is to use their new lock type": 1,
    "yeah": 2,
    "changing all this stuff takes time though =/": 1,
    "probably hold back doing the 2.0 release till i get all that in": 1,
    "i got stuck on a change i wanted to make with timers, kept running into walls": 1,
    "it's one fo the spots where i dont do object pooling, so each timer allocates. i wanted to pool them but it turned out really hard": 1,
    "speed": 1,
    "everything i've been talking about so far is about performance": 1,
    "i think the server is actually really performant already, but more can't hurt": 1,
    "yea, there are a ton of places though": 1,
    "gonna be fun to find them all": 1,
    "i can never make that shot": 1,

    "all the performance changes i put in were probably unneceseary though": 1,
    "yea, well in the latest version the trie is mostly replaced :p": 1,
    "yeah, learned a lot": 1,
    "the project was far different than the business work i had been using c# for for so long": 1,
    "i'm actually not sure how bad it would have been had i not put all the effort in to avoid allocations": 1,
    "it probably would have been just fine": 1,
    "somehow that free infantry project was using .net frameowrk last i checked": 1,
    "not really, the main problem i had was dynamic loading": 1,
    "in .net framework it was assembly.load or assembly.loadfile or soemthing lke that": 1,
    "in .net core it uses something called an assemblyloadcontext (i think it's named)": 1,
    "they made it more of a plugin type of thing": 1,
    "i still have issues with unloadability": 1,
    "so i disabled that for now": 1,
    "it might be due to my overboard object pooling": 1,
    "it's so that people can extend the server just like asss": 1,
    "like, all of the pb modules are separate": 1,
    "interestingly asss, though written in c, is written in a pseudo-object oriented manner": 1,
    "so my project basically made it use the real objects": 1,
    "yea, it's all structs": 1,
    "and tons of function pointer happiness": 1,
    "yea, that's how it's designed": 1,
    "the maker didn't like c++": 1,
    "i've made more c++ stuff than c. reading asss is he most c i ever used": 1,
    "yea, that's the main selling point imo": 1,
    "but there really isn't much active development in ss these days": 1,
    "well, when asss was being developed, there were a lot of people interseted": 1,
    "so far the only once i've heard being interested are the t3g people": 1,

    "why am i missing? lol": 1,
    "did they workaround the getting kicked to spec for lag issue?": 1,
    "why are they using bots? lol": 1,
    "probably old stuff they got": 1,
    "but everything else was ok?": 1,
    "how many players?": 1,
    "nice, i actually haven't tried it with that many real players at the same time": 1,
    "i only connect multiple times locally to test": 1,
    "it's bad": 1,
    "thta's exactly what i did today": 1,
    "i got a new dishwasher, but even though they failed to install it i tipped them because they really did try hard to": 1,
    "except i dont have a working dishwasher at the moment :p": 1,
    "these installer/delivery guys are making very little": 1,
    "so i felt bad": 1,
    "it's the crap way the world works": 1,
    "it's how unlucky i am": 1,
    "i can't beat peppy anymore": 1,
    "oh no, i dont want to get beat up by peppy again": 1,
    "do you push forward or anything?": 1,
    "interesting, so it's like the cc shot where you have to give a tiny amount": 1,
    "so that other night in t3g seemed like the server works just fine": 1,
    "yep, that's the idea": 1,
    "i dont know why they use bots though": 1,
    "yeah, i don't have any idea what it takes to get permission to connect to ssc": 1,
    "my brain quickly got into deep headache mode with all the rapid firing": 1,
    "additinoally, i have graphics set with proximity for svs on bombs and mines": 1,
    "over there it seems like you had to hit direct for the most part": 1,
    "yeah, those settings seem geared towards ganging up on a single player": 1,
    "yeah, i was going to jump in each ship and then it locked me when i got to levi and that sucked": 1,
    "but by that time my head was spinning already so it didn't really matter": 1,
    "i was just interested in seeing how the server reacted with regards to lag and all": 1,
    "i didn't really notice any": 1,
    "yeah, modules that are plug-in assemblies": 1,
    "or rather, that are in plug-in assemblies": 1,
    "a module is just a class that gets constructed and loaded": 1,
    "you can dynamically load and unload": 1,
    "though, for the assembly, i do have an bug somewhere where unloading the assembly causes a crash": 1,
    "it starts later usually": 1,
    "i had a really rough time with the plugin assembly stuff, something called assemblyloadcontext i think it was": 1,
    "had to disable the ability to unload an assembly, otherwise it might randomly crash when unloading": 1,
    "so yea, i never really tried to unload a module, then replace the assembly with a new version, and then load the new version": 1,
    "if you're allowed to replace the file then it would be no issue": 1,
    "basically, the assembly will unload when there are no longer any references to objects related to the assembly": 1,
    "you can definitely load multiple versions of an assembly at the same time": 1,
    "each gets its own assemblyloadcontext": 1,
    "which is how it finds dependencies (other assemblies, libraries) that the plugin uses": 1,
    "so like you can have 1 plugin that uses version 1 of a library. and another plugin that also uses the library, but version 2 of the library": 1,
    "and it will work": 1,
    "what i put in the server is based on their example": 1,
    "though for some reason if i enable the unloadability part of it, it randomly blows up": 1,
    "yeah, it would just keep the old assembly in memory even though it's not being used": 1,
    "well, memory costs money when you're paying for a vm": 1,
    "not that it's a lot, but it would add up if you keep trying to update without ever restarting": 1,
    "lol crap it didn't grab": 1,
    "practice": 1,
    "i got tired real fast": 1,
    "i caught something from the 2nd round dishwasher installers that didn't bring the correct water hose =/": 1,
    "in the end, they finally \"completed\" it on round 3": 1,
    "though, technically i'm going to have to fix what they did": 1,
    "so i wasted my $ paying for installation": 1,
    "almost had it": 1,
    "the shikaa has arrived": 1,
    "on gp, lol": 1,
    "make mercury play pb again": 1,
    "lol i knew he'd say that": 1,
    "what did you ask?": 1,
    "i've been meaning to get back into working on the server": 1,
    "took a good 2 months off": 1,
    "i was burnt out": 1,
    "plus lots of other things to take care of": 1,
    "though technically i still have stuff to take care of": 1,
    "so not sure how i'll manage to work on it": 1,
    "well, i have to fix the stuff from t3g. i just told them what to change": 1,
    "but i need to look into it further": 1,
    "plus when i left off i was in the middle of getting rid of as many intellisense suggestions as possible": 1,
    "i also have a few more things i wanted to look into before making the 2.0 build": 1,
    "yea, there are no errors or warnings, just that other category which tells you to it thinks something should be changed to be better": 1,
    "usually for newer language features": 1,
    "there are a lot": 1,
    "yea i don't like some": 1,
    "i also wanted to look into using a .editorconfig": 1,
    "i'm not super familiar with it though, just that it exists": 1,

    "i had issues with indentation that i thought i corrected, but i keep finding more": 1,
    "tabs vs space and stuff": 1,
