    "i assume it's heavily weighted towards goals": 1,
    "elo for team games is such a flawed method": 1,

    "it's not fun learning you're hideous at anything :)": 1,
    "i don't know about that": 1,
    "it's interesting regardless.": 1,

    "there's lots of examples of that sort of thing that are odd to me.": 1,
    "cc has no ability to shoot other players and wildly shoots empty space. it's funny": 1,
    "that's cool.": 1,
    "i watch a lot.": 1,
    "just using it as an example.": 1,
    "pallone1 is another outlier to me": 1,
    "good player. great sense of position. good slides... weird weird passes": 1,
    "the biggest problem with this game imo was called out by shaun this weekend": 1,
    "nobody helps others.": 1,
    "afri and you are the only ones with a positive interest in doing so": 1,
    "afri is fantastic in that regard.": 1,
    "another takeaway from that list...": 1,
    "is how few people play this game.  if you remove all sub-100 games entered, the list is tiny": 1,
    "^^ you're right of course": 1,
    "i am bitter and jaded after being berrated so long.": 1,
    "before you showed up, gunishment and merc and mirror were relentlessly asshole-y to me.": 1,
    "non stop insults, game related and not.": 1,
    "mirror mostly saves that for chaos/league nowadays.": 1,
    "for mirror and merc it goes back 25 years.": 1,
    "mirror was a total troll 25 years ago in chaos/warzone/etc. lol": 1,
    "how do you mean?": 1,
    "he's a newbie :)": 1,
    "yeah, mine was 69 on vie's biller": 1,
    "easy number to remember haha": 1,
    "when vie closed down, evderyone had to transition to the euro biller which was user run": 1,
    "my name, \"katt\" was taken (since it means \"cat\" in many languages) and i had to choose kattster": 1,
    "was annoying :)": 1,
    "yeah i played sniper back in 95 which became subspace. came from warcraft ii": 1,
    "just a random hop onto an alpha test": 1,
    "tool was one of the original guys too and brought something up i forgot": 1,
    "on the cd/liner notes, there is a list of names that vie thanked": 1,
    "and many of us are on there aliased because we were afraid of giving out our real names hahahaha": 1,
    "which in retrospect is a good idea.": 1,
    "i have the cd and instruction manual but not the box": 1,
    "i quit in 2007 or something and didn't come back until 2020...": 1,
    "i wish i could understand why i'm so bad.": 1,
    "i only play, i believe, because it's the only humbling thing i have in life these days": 1,
    "i wasn't always bad. i won the ssbowl 4v4 pyramid and was mvp and went to the first 7 season finals in pro league": 1,
    "so i used to be good at this lol": 1,
    "well i mean it's just subspace but the point is...": 1,
    "how does one forget how to play?": 1,
    "absolutely.": 1,
    "4v4 isn't really the same game as it used to be.": 1,
    "people don't really 4v4 these days.": 1,
    "it's more like chaos pub with some allies.": 1,
    "i also think people were much younger then and enjoyed it for different reasons": 1,
    "the top league teams were really teams": 1,
    "coordinated.": 1,
    "with roles.": 1,
    "yeah that's sort of how i see 4v4 now.": 1,
    "pracs especially are just random": 1,
    "so yeah, uh": 1,
    "my apologies to you, then...": 1,
    "for having to carry me so much when we play. like i said, i really wasn't aware as to how bad i am.": 1,
    "lol funny how that is": 1,
    "one thing i've noticed about you...": 1,
    "is that you're adaptive": 1,
    "you consider your teammates and adapt to play with them whereas many others such as gunishment insist people play one way and one way only (without actually communicating it)": 1,
    "you're flexible in your approach to the game.": 1,
    "i've always been that way with the things i do. when creating and growing my business, i had to learn to be extremely adapative.": 1,
    "utilizing the strengths of others and mitigating against the shortcomings in a crucial skill to master": 1,
    "in this game, i also try to be adaptive. when playing with you for example, i don't really try to score because you're strong at that. i instead try to keep pocession, keep you alive, and feed you opportunities...": 1,
    "with furz, i try to feed him opps to slide and score but also have to be close to him when he'll die randomly... etc etc.": 1,
    "you're great at telegraphing": 1,
    "i've started to do that": 1,
    "we used to do that in league...": 1,
    "even using our ship almost like a hand... waving in a direction... etc.": 1,
    "shaking the nose to indicate something etc": 1,
    "this was before voice comms.": 1,
    "with players like cc or giga or other good but not great guys, i know i have to try to score, too.": 1,
    "i also know i have to slow my ship and go in straight lines only because they can't pass/predict where somebody will be": 1,
    "apparently i'm doing it all badly though. damn :) haha": 1,
    "i had fun this weekend at least. a few folks that avoid passing to me even when i slide into the goal right in front of them actually passed to me and i dunked a half dozen times at least.": 1,
    "mirror will *literally* pass to an enemy before he'll pass to me.": 1,
    "he has a thing with a lot people": 1,
    "and i'm one of them.": 1,
    "curious what that list is": 1,
    "you left yourself out.": 1,
    "tool is an odd addition imo. his ball handling is poor": 1,
    "i'd consider peabrain > tool by a large margin": 1,
    "ibex > tool too": 1,
    "peabrain used to be great back in the day. he's an oddball in terms of his try-factor. he \"fades out\" in games a lot": 1,
    "not just here but in 4v4": 1,
    "i'd consider furz > ibex": 1,
    "i thought i was on par with ibex but i guess not. i beat him 1v1 every time we've played but that's different i guess.": 1,
    "but occasionally i try": 1,
    "it's so slow": 1,
    "lemonaire is another intersting player": 1,
    "palone1 and lemon are intersting to consider imo": 1,
    "but again what do i know lol": 1,
    "apparently nothing": 1,
    "pal and lemon are similar in that they both show signs of greatness but are extremely inconsistent": 1,
    "i'd put richard in that category too": 1,
    "in that they're able to do some great things and show high-level stuff but often their basics are really really flawed": 1,
    "ie, consistently bad passing or something easy whereas they make tough plays with apparent ease": 1,
    "one thing i've noticed that's been consistent with 4v4 is the ability of certain players to track thte position of other players (or the ball, for that matter)": 1,
    "some peoplare just incredibly badd with tracking more than 2 or 3 objects.": 1,
    "others can track 8 or 10.": 1,
    "it's also just basic mot ability": 1,
    "in league, lots of times a target is called and half the population has no idea where that player is at any given time unless they fly by them onscreen": 1,
    "others know exactly where all players are at all times.": 1,
    "in league it's really as simple as trackign 4 objects (the enemy team)": 1,
    "people are good at different things.": 1,
    "gunishment for example is hideous at 4v4. his mechanics are fantastic but his ability to understand position, track other ships, see opportunities and risks, etc, is really low (game iq)": 1,
    "but he's great mechanically and a real dangerous if he catches you 1on1 in a bad place.": 1,
    "^^ yup": 1,
    "i dont know if you've ever seen three online in 4v4. (the name \"three\")": 1,
    "his mechanics aren't particuarly great... average at best.. but he's top with game iq and situational awareness and knowing how to coordinate with a team. nobody is better (these days)": 1,
    "like anything, there's many ways to be successful at the same activiity": 1,
    "which is why creating a ratings system is difficult.": 1,
    "(full circle, if you noticed)": 1,
    "how so?": 1,
    "that's interesting! tell me more": 1,
    "oh you mean...w ithout the ball, yeah?": 1,
    "when i do that, i'm just fucking with people honestly": 1,
    "notice i don't really do that with players like you afri or the like but will always do it with mercury": 1,
    "i know that i won't get the pass so i will often just go into goal to kill goalie knowing full well i can use nrg in there and die since i will never get the ball.": 1,
    "oh i mean with youk, not against you :)": 1,
    "it's one of those intances where you gotta find some role to play": 1,
    "if you're unable to play the role you want for one reason or another, you look for another.": 1,
    "i wonder.": 1,
    "i really can't figure out that person.": 1,
    "i've tried recently to play with him as i would anyone... ie, passing to him, expecting him to do normal things": 1,
    "and he didn't.": 1,
    "with guys like merc who are ego-driven guys i figure the best i can do is just clear a path": 1,
    "know what i mean?": 1,
    "i suspect that it's wrong 95% of the time.": 1,
    "i've been on voice with most of these people (25 years ago and recently) and they're all so different there than in the game lol": 1,
    "retroaction is one of the nicest people": 1,
    "mirror can barely string together a sentence (this is not intended as an insult but \"matter of fact\") and seems very odd (that part is an opinion)": 1,
    "merc, no. i'd like to. i suspect he'd be less of a dick": 1,
    "gunishment is much nicer and has a joking personality": 1,
    "you'd be shocked to know that...": 1,
    "nearly everything out of my mouth is a joke": 1,
    "every squad i've been on, we've had a lot of fun laughing out asses off": 1,
    "there's no point in being \"social\" in a game if you can't have fun :)": 1,
    "we had a good time the last few seasons of draft league": 1,
    "i'd never be on a toxic squad. i'd quit if it was that. there's been several from what i've been told. i don't see the point": 1,
    "yeah, it did with teamspeak": 1,
    "early on in league we also used conference calls haha": 1,
    "yeah when the ... what was it.. in 2020 when that draft team thing was going on...": 1,
    "i was on tool's team. you'd think he'd be toxic as hell but he was great": 1,

    "and tom petty is stronger": 1,
    "it's interesting": 1,
    "ebb and flow": 1,
    "and never a dick": 1,
    "he was on that team i was telling you about... with tool as captain... was on voice with solar and a few others.. i think giga too...": 1,
    "all really nice folks": 1,
    "yeah, lots of people saying stuff about nab lately. i'm finding it good.": 1,
    "nab said something insightful the other day that has stuck with me": 1,
    "and it's ironic given my squadname": 1,
    "he said \"you have a strong sense of justice\"": 1,
    "benji was really great back in the day too": 1,
