    "coward.": 1,
    "fkr dies again.": 1,
    "fkr makes a nice shot.": 1,
    "lag is a big deal.": 1,
    "in a zone designed basically for one shot kills, when you lag through mines, bombs, bullets that should kill you, it makes a big deal.": 1,
    "bullshit.": 1,
    "spoken like a person who uses lag as an advantage.": 1,
    "if you're lagging and your intended target isn't, them not dying to your lag bullets / bombs isn't there fault. it's yours.": 1,
    "trying to justify your lag as a means to explain off some side-effects that sometimes effect you, is laughable at best.": 1,
    "take fkr for instance, he's not lagging currently and he's doing fine.": 1,
    "earlier in pub however he was taking 50% to the face and nothing.": 1,
    "interesting back-handed comment trying to sound as though you can hold an intelligent argument and yet you spell \"you're\" incorrectly.": 1,

    "a little early in the morning for shark week fellas...": 1,
    "didn't he get 2 kills on you to your 1 on him?": 1,
    "how is that losing?": 1,

    "we doing bugs?!": 1,
    "i'm so fucking there.": 1,
    "best. event. ever.": 1,
    "it's hilarious how you insult him by saying he sounds like someone who forgot to go to school, yet can't form a complete sentence.": 1,
    "the irony is not lost.": 1,
    "you going to duck me again?": 1,
    "you sent me a 2 mil challenge. i accepted it and you left. you came back as your alias and got owned 5-2 for 10k.": 1,

    "i like how airduster is attempting to troll. it's cute seeing his lack of education come out.": 1,
    "the word you're looking for is \"worse\" sir.": 1,
    "even attempting to insult someone you fail.": 1,
    "bro, you're failing in multiple area's here.": 1,
    "and are now trying to mask it with your failed attempt to cover up the fact that you can't spell shit.": 1,
    "you're incredibly bad man.": 1,
    "you can't play this game. you can't troll. you can't even fucking spell.": 1,
    "you're just overall bad.": 1,
    "no sir, you're attempting to troll. you're failing miserably.": 1,
