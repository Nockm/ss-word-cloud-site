1. tom petty (The Relaxed Wit)

Rank: Most Level-Headed Still the gold standard for calm. He uses humor and pop culture to diffuse tension and views the game through a lens of entertainment.
2. shikaa (The Casual Socialite)

Rank: Playful & Food-Oriented Maintains a very lighthearted attitude. Their focus on cinnamon rolls and self-mocking jokes makes them one of the most pleasant presences in the chat.
3. the seven year itch (The Energetic Hype-Man)

Rank: Playfully Dramatic Upgraded from #6. With the context that their talk of "bad guys" and "choking" is a bit, they emerge as the heartbeat of the lobby. They are highly social, deeply engaged, and their "aggression" is actually a form of inclusive banter that keeps the games running and the energy high.
4. abo (The Stoic Veteran)

Rank: Stable & Experienced Abo remains high on the list for their "cheers" and general politeness, though they have a lower tolerance for poor play than the top three and will simply leave if the game isn't meeting their standards.
5. shaun (The Focused Specialist)

Rank: Eccentric & Technical Shaun isn't mean-spirited, but their extreme focus on racing records and technical minutiae makes them less "socially relaxed" than the people above them. They are in their own world of wall-bounces and personal history.
6. mercury (The Provocateur)

Rank: High-Energy Banter Mercury is the classic "troll" in the group. While mostly playful, the sheer volume of "lol" and "choke" (1,360 times!) suggests they enjoy the friction. They aren't "angry," but they aren't exactly "calm" either—they are constantly trying to get a reaction.
7. sawhetowl (The Fragmented/Reactive)

Rank: Short Fuse Unlike 'itch', Sawhetowl’s outbursts ("stfu and die") feel less like a coordinated "bit" and more like genuine reactive frustration. Their keyboard-mashing and abrupt insults put them lower on the temperament scale.
8. lemonaire (The Harsh Critic)

Rank: Hyper-Critical Lemonaire’s temperament is defined by performance-based negativity. Labeling teammates as "dead weight" or "low risk players" creates a serious, high-pressure environment that drains the fun for others.
9. nabakatsu (The Irritable Gatekeeper)

Rank: Impatient & Blunt Nabakatsu has a very low threshold for social interaction during games. Their commands to "stop fucking talking" and focus on the match indicate a temperament that is easily bothered by the presence of other players' personalities.
10. zwix (The Hostile Elitist)

Rank: Most Volatile Zwix remains the outlier. Regardless of their recipes for avocado oil, their history of elitism ("go read books") and extreme real-world threats puts them at the bottom of any temperament ranking.
