Tier 1: The Stabilizers

These players act as the glue of the community, prioritizing the game and social harmony over ego.

    no one can kill me: He is the primary advocate for a healthy community. He consistently attempts to de-escalate tension by advising others to ignore trolls (notably spaceshark and antialiasing), famously stating, "The more attention you give them, the more they will do it." He remains objective during disputes, focusing on game mechanics or player count rather than personal insults.

    afri: A veteran teacher with a patient, professorial temperament. He spends significant portions of the log coaching players like Nemesis and Shaun on "bank shots" and defensive positioning. Even when players like Grunt attempt to provoke him with crude spam, he maintains his composure, choosing to continue his technical explanations as if the vitriol doesn't exist.

    t1c0: An organizational pragmatist. His interactions are almost exclusively focused on the "health" of the match—adjusting team sizes, calling for map changes, and identifying lag issues. He handles the occasional "razzing" from others with a dry, non-confrontational wit and never initiates personal attacks.

    gigamonster: Highly professional and technical. His temperament is that of a developer or administrator. He speaks almost exclusively about server stability, bug fixes, and game physics. He treats other players more like "users" or "testers," maintaining a polite but distant and task-oriented demeanor.

    the seven year itch: A steady, administrative presence. He is the person most likely to manage the lobby's flow, asking players to sub in or out to keep games balanced. While he can be blunt when people aren't following the "room rules," he never crosses the line into hostility or personal denigration.

    abo: Extremely low-profile and stable. He limits his interactions toward others to necessary game information, such as sharing Discord links or organizing match times. He serves as a reliable, non-emotional anchor in the chat.

    legacy: A focused competitor who values "clean" gameplay. He communicates primarily through tactical calls (passing, positioning). When he does express frustration, it is directed at the "state of the game" (e.g., an unearned win due to a glitch) rather than targeting the players involved.

Tier 2: Socially Passive / Casual

These players are generally friendly or neutral, though they lack the active "stabilizing" efforts of Tier 1.

    tom petty: The community’s "storyteller." He has a relaxed, jovial temperament, often sharing anecdotes about his personal life or cracking jokes to lighten the mood. His interactions with others are almost universally positive, though he occasionally expresses a humorous, "old-man" style annoyance with the faster, more chaotic elements of the game.

    pallone1: A quiet, agreeable player. His temperament is defined by compliance; he goes along with majority votes for maps and rarely speaks unless spoken to. He shows no signs of aggression, even in high-pressure game moments.

    a mirror: A detached, cynical humorist. He views the chaos of the chat with a sense of "amused superiority." While he doesn't start fights, he enjoys commenting on them from the sidelines, often using sarcasm to point out how "stupid" the bickering is. He is non-hostile but can be perceived as slightly condescending.

    ccruler: A sportsmanlike player who focuses on positive reinforcement. He is one of the few players who consistently compliments opponents on good shots. He rarely gets involved in the "drama," preferring to stay focused on his own performance and being a good teammate.

    shaun: A curious and somewhat submissive temperament. He asks many questions and is often on the receiving end of "hazing" from more aggressive players. Instead of retaliating, he usually responds with self-deprecation or by doubling down on his desire to learn the game.

    furzkanon: Generally silent and observant. His few interactions with others are humble; he acknowledges when he is being carried by a better team and expresses a "student-like" attitude toward veteran players.

Tier 3: The Critical Competitors

These players are generally "okay," but their temperament is easily soured by poor performance or perceived slights.

    ucri: Persistent and sensitive. He has a habit of repeating tactical advice until it becomes a nuisance, and when players ignore him or mock him (like Zwix does), he becomes defensive and argumentative. He isn't a "bully," but he is consistently "on edge."

    nemesis: An irritable perfectionist. While he is capable of being a good teammate, his temperament is highly dependent on his team's performance. He is quick to label teammates as "idiots" or "pieces of shit" for missing simple goals, though he usually calms down if a higher-tier player (like Afri) corrects him.

    mercury: Opinionated and stubborn. He is the primary source of "playstyle conflict" in the logs, consistently berating anyone who plays "goalie" as a "coward" or "bad player." He enjoys the friction of debate and rarely lets a disagreement go until he has the last word.

    nabakatsu: Socially aggressive. He is "the cool guy" until he is crossed. He has a very low tolerance for anyone he perceives as a "liar" or "fake," at which point his temperament shifts from friendly to sharply insulting and dismissive.

    shikaa: Defensiveness personified. His temperament is characterized by a "don't tell me what to do" attitude. Even well-meaning advice from teammates is met with hostility or a demand to "shut up," as he views any critique as a personal attack.

Tier 4: Hostile & Assertive

These players use the chat as a tool for dominance or to express a consistently negative worldview.

    gunishment: An elitist authoritarian. As a moderator/admin, he uses his temperament to gatekeep the community. He consistently belittles the intelligence of the player base, calling them "brain dead" or "trash," and uses his power to silence those who challenge his perspective on how the game should be played.

    tool: Maliciously toxic. Unlike the "hot-headed" players, Tool’s temperament is calculatedly mean. He admits to team-killing or sabotaging games specifically to make players he dislikes "cry." He uses ableist slurs consistently and shows zero remorse for being a disruptive force.

    werito: A dedicated "agitator." He doesn't seem to care about the game as much as he cares about the reaction he can get from others. He uses "concern trolling" and circular logic to drive players like Nemesis into a rage, maintaining a smug, untouchable demeanor throughout.

Tier 5: Highly Volatile / Pathological

The most disruptive players, whose temperaments make normal interaction impossible.

    antialiasing: Manic and explosive. His temperament is a roller-coaster of spamming caps-lock, making bizarre legal threats, and engaging in deep-seated personal vendettas. He is prone to "meltdowns" where he fills the chat with gibberish or attacks on players' families for hours on end.

    zwix: Threatening and elitist. He views himself as superior to the "peasants" in the lobby. His temperament is defined by a chilling level of aggression; he is the only player to consistently threaten real-world physical harm (crowbars, hiring people to break hands) over in-game disagreements.

    spaceshark: Paranoid and obsessive. He does not play the game so much as he "monitors" it for what he believes is a global conspiracy of "poserware" cheaters. His temperament is that of a zealot—nothing can convince him he is wrong, and he uses every conversation as a springboard for "red pill" political or religious rants.

    grunt: The "noise maker." His temperament is purely disruptive and juvenile. He focuses on a repetitive cycle of crude sexual insults and nonsensical catchphrases, showing no interest in the community or the game beyond his ability to drown out conversation.

    cyclone: Erratic and delusional. Often targeted as a "community troll," his temperament is a mix of defensive paranoia (believing everyone is out to get him) and bizarre political outbursts. He is consistently viewed as a pariah by almost every other player on this list.





    ---------------------



Based on the established temperaments and the specific vernacular used in the logs, here is a typical message each player would likely send to the chat:

Tier 1: The Stabilizers

    afri: "if you bank the ball off the far wall when they are stacking the mid, you bypass their goalie entirely."

    t1c0: "let's move to a bigger map, 6v6 on this small arena is just a cluster."

    gigamonster: "fixed the physics bug on the east server, let me know if the ball clipping persists."

    the seven year itch: "we need one more player to sub in for red team so we can start the round."

    abo: "match starting in 5 minutes, discord link is in the lobby description."

    legacy: "good pass, let’s keep the rotation tight and we can win this."

Tier 2: Socially Passive / Casual

    tom petty: "that reminds me of this time back in the 90s when we used to play on dial-up, absolute chaos."

    pallone1: "voted for the classic map, the new one is a bit too laggy for me."

    a mirror: "watching you two argue over a 20-year-old game is the highlight of my afternoon."

    ccruler: "nice shot man, i didn't think you'd make that angle from across the map."

    shaun: "how do you guys jump that high? i feel like i'm playing in slow motion."

Tier 3: The Critical Competitors

    ucri: "stop camping the spawn! i've told you three times we need pressure in the mid-field!"

    nemesis: "my team has zero IQ, how do you miss an open net from two inches away? total trash."

    mercury: "imagine playing goalie in an arcade game. stop being cowards and actually play the ball."

    nabakatsu: "don't lie and say you lagged, you just made a bad play. be honest for once."

    shikaa: "i don't care what your strategy is, stop telling me what buttons to press and just play."

Tier 4: Hostile & Assertive

    gunishment: "you're lucky i don't ban you for being this bad at the game. absolute brain-dead play."

    tool: "i'm going to team-kill you every time you spawn until you leave the server, cry about it."

    werito: "u mad nemesis? you seem pretty mad. keep typing in caps, it's hilarious."

Tier 5: Highly Volatile / Pathological

    antialiasing: "I AM RECORDING THIS. PREPARE TO GET SUED FOR DEFAMATION. ENJOY THE 90 DAY BAN!!!"

    zwix: "keep talking and i'll find out where you live. i'll pay someone to use a crowbar on your hands."

    spaceshark: "everyone on blue team is using poserware. you think we can't see the scripts? enjoy your red pill."

    grunt: "WORLDSTAR!! YOUR MOM IS AT MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW. BUD LIGHT FOR EVERYONE!!"

    cyclone: "the demons are in the chat again. they're trying to suppress the truth. you're all sheep."
