Tier 1: High Malice / Intentional Toxicity

These players use their status as veterans or elites to justify bullying and intentional friction.

    tool

        Temperament: Malignant Nostalgia. The most vitriolic presence. He anchors his ego to 20-year-old accolades and treats current gameplay errors as personal insults. His malice is voluntary; he chooses to degrade others and team-kill to "enforce" a standard most cannot meet.

        Example Messages:

            "this guy is fucking retarded"

            "teamkilling zwix is a winning strategy"

            "why dont you people pay for better internet"

    gunishment

        Temperament: Authoritative Bully. Leverages moderator status to gatekeep. He voluntarily belittles players he deems "trash" to assert dominance, creating a hostile environment for anyone he deems unworthy of the zone.

        Example Messages:

            "youre dogshit in every zone"

            "need to introduce some kind of elitism to pb"

            "sizzle sells the sausage"

    mercury

        Temperament: Cynical Deflector. The architect of the "fish" slur. He voluntarily dismisses the skill of others as "lag" or "cowardice" (the goalie barrel) to protect his own elite ego when he cannot find a way to score.

        Example Messages:

            "really hard to stop that guy" (Sarcastic lag accusation)

            "like shooting fish in a barrel"

            "dumbasses who always run to goal"

Tier 2: Ego-Shielding & Strategic Friction

These players create friction through moralizing, intellectual elitism, or tactical selfishness to protect their reputation or "principles."

    zwix

        Temperament: Academic Elitist. Prioritizes "principles" over success. He is irrationally triggered by "illegal" tactics like enemy goal-sitting. He uses this moral gatekeeping to compensate for his own performance limitations.

        Example Messages:

            "u read more books than me... u a moron"

            "i in the top tier here. just by the way i play"

            "the only goal also.. haha"

    nemesis

        Temperament: Performative Moralist. Quick to criticize but masks it as "zone improvement." He uses self-serving lectures to validate his image as a "good guy" despite his own inconsistent play and poor dependability.

        Example Messages:

            "I’m trying to make this place better"

            "save the toxicity for league"

            "you're a shitty person who enjoys making people less happy"

    ucri

        Temperament: Stat-Conscious Opportunist. Voluntarily avoids competitive balance by "cherry-picking" winning teams (powerplays). While often playful with his "POW POW" catchphrase, his behavior is driven by preserving his record over game quality.

        Example Messages:

            "wake me up when its a powerplay"

            "my kd is trashed"

            "POW POW POWER PLAY"

    nabakatsu

        Temperament: Moralizing Dissonance. The "Hero-Baller." He trades 99% success passes for unnecessary 50% bank passes. When he fails or plays erratic goalie, he retreats into spiritual Ayahuasca talk to avoid accountability.

        Example Messages:

            "maintain your chill"

            "ayahuasca can regrow neural pathways"

            "i was lecturing actually"

Tier 3: The Disconnected & Erratic

Behaviors here are less about targeted malice and more about social disconnect or a lack of situational flow.

    spaceshark (nin9)

        Temperament: Systematized Delusional. Toxicity fueled by a belief in "poserware" conspiracies. He views the game through a lens of paranoia rather than simple bullying, believing the physics are rigged specifically against him.

        Example Messages:

            "poserware programs"

            "magnetic charges on the ball"

            "GAME NEEDS A PURGE ON POSERWARE"

    cyclone

        Temperament: Static / Discordant. Lowest technique. He "goal-sits" (triggering zwix) and speaks in "smart" non-sequiturs, causing team friction due to a total disconnect from Newtonian momentum.

        Example Messages:

            "god made woman mans helper"

            "dont vote for demoncrats"

            "the ball was coming to me"

    peabrain (pea)

        Temperament: Erratic Stoic. Mostly silent but prone to being distracted and inconsistent. While not malicious, his erratic focus and average technique often make him a primary target for Tier 1 elite salt.

        Example Messages: (Silent—usually provides no chat log evidence)

Tier 4: Functional Realists & Modest Elites

High-skill players who prioritize the actual physics and the "chess game" over personal drama.

    afri

        Temperament: Pragmatic / Fatigued. Blunt about "carrying weight," but focuses purely on the balance of probabilities for a win. He is an elite player who is simply tired of the friction.

        Example Messages:

            "SCRIM FATIGUE IS REAL"

            "extra weight for me to carry"

            "its a balance of probabilities"

    the seven year itch

        Temperament: Confident Leader. A strategic leader who acknowledges his own "chokes" while focusing on practical success. He is the one who coined the phrase "hero time for naba."

        Example Messages:

            "time to put team on my back"

            "7 chokes for seven"

            "hero time for naba"

    a mirror (Sath)

        Temperament: Direct Pragmatist. Shuts down whiners and focuses on the technical aspects of the zone, game settings, and maintaining a "safe then sorry" approach.

        Example Messages:

            "gotta play the safe then sorry approach"

            "god do u cry about everything"

            "i got a blackbelt in slaughtering words"

    no one can kill me

        Temperament: Analytical Diplomat. The "Scientist." Uses data and humor to stay balanced and defuse the "fish" drama. He separates his social persona from his high-level mechanical play.

        Example Messages:

            "cognitive bias is real"

            "that's what she said"

            "can you help me with a quick experiment"

    legacy

        Temperament: Participant Veteran. A skilled player who participates without the aggressive elitism of other veterans. While occasionally referencing duels, he is generally less toxic than the higher tiers.

        Example Messages:

            "such an unearned win"

            "el caca shut up and duel me"

            "gg"

Tier 5: Social Glue & Stability

The most balanced players who provide the social and technical stability for the zone to function.

        "lighten up good fellows", "we're all friends here", "it's just a game"

    tom petty: The Hobbyist. Uses self-deprecating humor and "newbie" jokes to avoid ego traps.
